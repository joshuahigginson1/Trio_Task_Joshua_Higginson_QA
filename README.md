# Trio Task - QA Consulting

🐳 🐳 🐳 Introducing docker-compose 🐳 🐳 🐳

-----

## Project Brief

This Repo contains my solutions for the 'Trio Task', challenged by Harry Volker @ QA consulting.

The brief was to configure a trio of containers using docker-compose.

The trio consists of:
- A basic Flask application.
- A MYSQL database.
- An NGINX proxy web server.

> Write a docker-compose.yaml that will bring all these services up and allow the app to run on port `80`.
